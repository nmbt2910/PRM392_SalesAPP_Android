### Key Features ‚ú®

You've completed several core functionalities of the app. Here's a breakdown of the implemented features:

* **Authentication:** Users can securely **sign up** and **log in** with their credentials. Passwords are **securely hashed** to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Product Catalog:** The app fetches and displays a list of products from a remote database via a RESTful API. Each item includes its name, image, price, and a brief description. Users can also **sort and filter** the products.
* **Product Details:** From the product list, users can view a **detailed screen** with full descriptions, specifications, and multiple images. They can also add the product to their cart from this screen.
* **Shopping Cart:** The app provides a dedicated cart screen where users can see all the items they've added. The cart can be **managed** by adjusting item quantities, removing products, or clearing the entire cart. The total cart amount is **dynamically updated** with any changes.
* **Notifications:** A **cart badge notification** is displayed on the app icon, showing the number of items in the cart even when the app is closed. This feature uses libraries like `NotificationCompat`.
